# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

## Solution

At every cycle we need to know the state of our car (lane, velocity and acceleration) and the state of the other vehicles (and their future state) in order to plan our next state, which basically will consist in defining the change of velocity and whether or not we need to change lanes. Finally, based on determining future state, we need to generate the corresponding trajectory.

So, the solution has three steps/areas to deal with: (1) prediction, (2) behavioral planning, and (3) trajectory generation. 


### Prediction 

For the prediction we predict future state of other vehicles so that we can use this information to plan our behaviour in order to run as fast as possible and to prevent any collision with other cars. 

The prediction information of other cars will determine the value of the cost function "obstacle_cost". Each lane is assigned a cost value, and our behaviour is determined by this (see next section 'Behavioral planning'). 

There are different areas where the prediction of other car's states influence the outcome of the solution:

- SAFE_DISTANCE_BEHIND/SAFE_DISTANCE_AHEAD: This is the distance behind of our vehicle and ahead of our vehicle where we look for other vehicles to determine the feasibility of chaning lanes. We do not want to change lanes if there is a vehicle within a certain distance of the target lane as this could cause a collision. The safe distance is also used to check if we have a vehicle ahead of us, which then we might need to look of there is another lane where there is no vehicles so that we can run faster. The value of the safe distance also changes depending on the speed of our vehicle and the speed of the other vehicle. For example, if a vehicle that is ahead of us is running faster than us, we set a lower safe distance. Similarly, when we try to change lanes, if we are running faster than a vehicle in the target lane that is behind us, we lower the safe distance. This is to make our car run faster. 

In the prediction state we also evaluate the speed lane. We look at the cars running within a certain distance from our car and we set the speed lane to the velocity of the lowest car running within a certain distance of our car.

### Behavioral planning 

We basically have three states: keep lane, change lane (right or left). To determine next state, we assign a cost value to each lane. Then we pick the lane that has a lowest cost. Then we move to that lane (or stay at our current lane if this is the one having the lowest cost). 

With the current implementation there is only one cost function, which assigns a cost value of each state (lane) based on the obstacles (vehicles) that are within this lane and within a certain distance of our car. Also, we set a very high cost for the lanes that are beyond next lane (e.g. if we are in lane 0, changing to lane 2 is considered impossible, so give a very high cost to lane 2).

In case the cost of our current state (lane) is the same of the cost of other states, we always give priority to stay in our current state.

Once the next lane is determined, we check the speed of that lane and we adjust the speed of our vehicle to the speed of this target lane. 

### Trajectory generation

We generate a trajectory based on the result of the behavioral planning. 

To generate a trajectory we took two prior points from our prior generated path (to ensure smooth transition) and three other points at 30, 60 and 90 meters ahead of us at the target lane determined by behavioral planning. 

We fit the polynomial with a spline and using the five points.

The spacing between points is determined based on the velocity of the car and the fact that the simulator visit each point every 0.02 seconds.
